  description: The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) is a ground-breaking collaboration between behavioural scientists, computer scientists and system architects, aiming to revolutionise methods for synthesising evidence about behaviour change and generate novel insights into behaviour change.
  behavioural_science: "Behavioural Scientists are developing an ‘ontology’ (The Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology – BCIO): a defined set of entities and their relationships. This will be used to organise information in a form that enables efficient accumulation of knowledge and enables links to other knowledge systems. They are also extracting information by hand to provide a reference set for the automated information extraction system."
  computer_science: "Computer Scientists are developing algorithms to automatically extract information from published reports. This is being used to populate a database of research findings structured according to the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO).  Machine Learning and reasoning algorithms are being developed to generate insights and answer queries from these data."
  system_architecture: "System Architects are developing user and machine interfaces for the Knowledge System. These will allow the system to be queried by practitioners, policy makers and researchers, and to interact with other automated systems."

      James Thomas is Professor of Social Research & Policy at the EPPI-Centre, UCL where he is Principal Investigator of the Department of Health Systematic Reviews Facility. This work involves conducting policy-relevant systematic reviews alongside the provision of training, national and international coordination work in evidence-based health promotion and public health, and the creation and maintenance of online evidence databases. James Thomas’s research career is centred on improving policy and decision-making through more creative use and appreciation of existing knowledge. It covers substantive disciplinary fields – such as health promotion, public health and education – and also the development of tools and methods that support this work conducted both within University College London (UCL) and in the wider community.

        He has written extensively on research synthesis, including meta-analysis and methods for combining qualitative and quantitative research in ‘mixed method’ reviews; and also designed EPPI-Reviewer, software which manages data through all stages of a systematic review, which has recently been adopted by NICE and Cochrane to support evidence synthesis in these organisations. He is currently co-lead of the Cochrane ‘Project Transform’ which is implementing novel technologies and process (including machine learning and crowdsourcing) to improve the efficiency of systematic reviews and increase their responsiveness to user needs and timescales.

    description: |
      John Shawe-Taylor is Professor of Computer Science at UCL and has contributed to a number of fields ranging from graph theory through cryptography to statistical learning theory and its applications. However, his main contributions have been in the development of the analysis and subsequent algorithmic definition of principled machine learning algorithms founded in statistical learning theory. This work has helped to drive a fundamental rebirth in the field of machine learning with the introduction of kernel methods and support vector machines, including the mapping of these approaches onto novel domains including work in computer vision, document classification and brain scan analysis. More recently he has worked on interactive learning and reinforcement learning, both of which will be relevant to the current proposal.

      He has also been instrumental in assembling a series of influential European Networks of Excellence (initially the NeuroCOLT projects and later the PASCAL networks). The scientific coordination of these projects has influenced a generation of researchers and promoted the widespread uptake of machine learning in both science and industry that we are currently witnessing.

      He has published over 300 papers with an H index of 60 and over 42000 citations (Google scholar). Two books co-authored with Nello Cristianini have become standard monographs for the study of kernel methods and support vector machines and together have attracted 21000 citations.

        Pol Mac Aonghusa is a Senior Research Manager at the IBM Research Lab in Dublin responsible for research projects in Artificial Intelligence, Semantic Web Technologies and Data Privacy.

        My research interests for the past 5 years have been in applying semantic web technologies to problems in machine learning and optimization. Our early work won prizes in the International Semantic Web Challenge in 2012 and 2013. More recently we have been investigating how to assist Social Care-workers and Care Teams make more informed decisions with incomplete and uncertain data. I am pleased that parts of this work are now in transition to our IBM Watson Health solution portfolio.

        My personal research interests are in online privacy as a pragmatic tradeoff between perceptions of utility, risk and cost. Users are prepared to trade an acceptable amount of risk in return for utility gained. I'm currently looking at how users can actively detect, understand and adapt their privacy utility-risk-cost balance as they interact with systems.

        In addition to applied research for IBM products Pol is also responsible for several EU funded research projects. These include ProAct (Assisted Independent Living for people with Multiple Co-morbidities) and PETRA (Multi-model Journey Planning).
